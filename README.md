# text-game
just a game i wanted to make in my free time

CODE_PYTHONISTA.py is for pythonista and it uses an old version of the "console" library
CODE_GLOBAL.py is for everyone else, as I changed "console" to a different library - everything else is the same.

Some ascii art looks better in pythonista, but I can't fix that because it's just how it works, also the other color library doesn't look the same, but it's not really important though it does bother me.

use the correct one, not that hard
